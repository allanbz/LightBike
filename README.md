### About the game

Java reboot of a game originally created by a friend in Turing. 
Multiplayer action game similar to Snake and Tron, cut your opponents off or trap them in!

### Development

The singleplayer/local multiplayer gameplay is almost complete! Future plans are to add several maps, player colour customization, and look into online client/host multiplayer!

Ideas and contributions are welcome.
