# About the game

Java reboot of a game originally created by a friend in Turing. 
Multiplayer action game similar to Snake and Tron, cut your opponents off or trap them in!

# Development

Right now the game is with basic structures (similarly as an snake game), we are focusing on game machanics and treating some erros, and then we'll build the base for the multiplayer gameplay.

Ideas, and tips are welcome.
